        <p>This is the game we created for our scratch project. It is meant to be played with a friend.
        The objective is to kill your opponent 10 times, in one of several ways. You can do damage
        to them, slam dunk them into the pit, or simply have them touch the edge of the screen.</p>
        <p>The Developement Process</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Brainstorming- First we came up with what we wanted to do</li>
            <li>Basic Code- We implemented what we wanted in the game</li>
            <li>Debugging- We made it so that you can't cheat or be killed unfairly</li>
            <li>Optimising- We made the controls easier to use for the enjoyment of the player</li>
        </ol>
        <p>During this project, I learned:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How to use algorithms</li>
            <li>How and when to use variables in coding</li>

        </video>
        <p>This app is called Hertz. It is a public speaking app, used to rehearse
        for plays, hear speeches and papers read back to you so that you can hear what
        they will sound like before you give them, and to encourage people to speak and
        think critically by giving them hypothetical problem to speak about.</p>
        <p>The Developement Process</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Brainstorming- We both wanted to do different things, but those things were related so we 
            did both</li>

            functions.</li>
            <li>Advanced Code- We made the code do more impressive and proper functions.</li>
            <li>Debugging- We made the code do exactly what it was supposed to, reading only
            certain lines in the recite section.</li>

        </video>
        <p>This is a python code that lets you play battleship. We did this as a project where we were given
        a list of possible projects to do, and this seemed like onne of the coolest. There were some problems,
        but the game works.</p>
