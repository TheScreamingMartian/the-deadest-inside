        <p>This is the game we created for our scratch project. It is meant to be played with a friend.
        The objective is to kill your opponent 10 times, in one of several ways. You can do damage
        to them, slam dunk them into the pit, or simply have them touch the edge of the screen.</p>
        <p>The Developement Process</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Brainstorming- First we came up with what we wanted to do</li>
            <li>Basic Code- We implemented what we wanted in the game</li>
            <li>Debugging- We made it so that you can't cheat or be killed unfairly</li>
            <li>Optimising- We made the controls easier to use for the enjoyment of the player</li>
        </ul>
        <p>During this project, I learned:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How to use algorithms</li>
            <li>How and when to use variables in coding</li>
            <li>Basic coding concepts</li>
            <li>How to use broadcasts</li>
        </ul>
